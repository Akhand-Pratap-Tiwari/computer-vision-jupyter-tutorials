# Computer-Vision
This repo contains step by step Jupyter notebooks with codes for people that are interested in computer vision. Things are easy starting from basic. Also there is not much explanation done as I did not feel the need for it. If some requests for it then it will be added. But the code in itself is quite explainable.

Parts are in series i.e., p0 -> p1 -> p2.... Try to move in series as this will gradually increase the difficulty.
